# elm-tailwind

### Note: 
this is a fork of splodingsocks/elm-tailwind with with incrementally new added features.

A small library that makes using [tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/what-is-tailwind/) a little easier and a little safer to use within Elm.

You'll find classes responding to Tailwind rules in Tailwind.Classes.

In there you'll also find functions for appending responsive qualifiers to those classes. Here's an example of what a div using tailwind might look like:

        div
            [ tailwind
                <| withClasses [ "__login_page" ] -- __login_page is not a tailwind class, it's just for marking the div's purpose.
                <| [ m_1, lg m_6 ]
            ]

# Ideas for Improvement

This library is mostly for autocomplete and avoiding spelling errors at the moment. A more ideal solution might be to make a type-safe api, maybe something like this:

To give types to: <https://tailwindcss.com/docs/spacing/#app>

    spacing : SpacingFlavor -> Side -> SpacingLength -> String

    type SpacingFlavor
        = Padding
        | Margin
        | NegMargin

    type Side
        = All
        | Top
        | Left
        | Right
        | Bottom
        | X
        | Y

    type SpacingLength
        = S0
        | S1
        | S2
        | S3
        | S4
        | S5
        | S6
        | S7
        | S8
        | Spx
        | Sauto

And a vertical padding could be expressed like so:

`padding Y S2`
