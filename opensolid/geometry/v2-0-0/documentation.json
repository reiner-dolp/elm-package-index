It can be thought of as:\n\n  - A local coordinate system: Most geometric types have associated `relativeTo`\n    and `placeIn` functions that convert values of that type from global\n    coordinates to local coordinates in a particular frame, and vice versa.\n  - A set of axes and planes: It is often convenient to (for example) rotate\n    around the Z axis of a frame, or mirror across its XY plane. Frames can\n    also themselves be translated, rotated and mirrored!\n  - A combined 3D position and orientation: For example, a `Frame3d` could be\n    used to define the position and orientation of a spaceship in a 3D game.\n    Movement of the ship would then be done by translating and rotating the\n    frame.\n\n@docs Frame3d\n\n\n# Constants\n\n@docs xyz\n\n\n# Constructors\n\n@docs atPoint, with, unsafe\n\n\n# Properties\n\n@docs originPoint, xDirection, yDirection, zDirection, isRightHanded\n\n\n## Axes\n\n@docs xAxis, yAxis, zAxis\n\n\n## Planes\n\nThe following functions all return planes with the same origin point as the\ngiven plane, but with varying normal directions. In each case the normal\ndirection of the resulting plane is given by the cross product of the two\nindicated basis directions (assuming a right-handed frame); for example,\n\n    Frame3d.xyPlane Frame3d.xyz\n    --> Plane3d.with\n    -->     { originPoint = Point3d.origin\n    -->     , normalDirection = Direction3d.positiveZ\n    -->     }\n\nsince the cross product of the X and Y basis directions of a frame is equal to\nits Z basis direction. And since reversing the order of arguments in a cross\nproduct reverses the sign of the result,\n\n    Frame3d.yxPlane Frame3d.xyz\n    --> Plane3d.with\n    -->     { originPoint = Point3d.origin\n    -->     , normalDirection = Direction3d.negativeZ\n    -->     }\n\n@docs xyPlane, yxPlane, yzPlane, zyPlane, zxPlane, xzPlane\n\n\n## Sketch planes\n\nThese functions all form a `SketchPlane3d` from two axes of the given frame. The\nX and Y axes of the sketch plane will correspond to the two indicated axes. For\nexample,\n\n    yzSketchPlane =\n        Frame3d.yzSketchPlane Frame3d.xyz\n\n    SketchPlane3d.originPoint yzSketchPlane\n    --> Point3d.origin\n\n    SketchPlane3d.xDirection yzSketchPlane\n    --> Direction3d.y\n\n    SketchPlane3d.yDirection yzSketchPlane\n    --> Direction3d.z\n\nNote that this can be confusing - for example, a local X coordinate in the above\nsketch plane corresponds to a global Y coordinate, and a local Y coordinate\ncorresponds to a global Z coordinate!\n\n@docs xySketchPlane, yxSketchPlane, yzSketchPlane, zySketchPlane, zxSketchPlane, xzSketchPlane\n\n\n# Transformations\n\n@docs flipX, flipY, flipZ, moveTo, rotateAround, rotateAroundOwn, translateBy, translateAlongOwn, mirrorAcross\n\n\n# Coordinate conversions\n\n@docs relativeTo, placeIn\n\n",

Sketch planes are the primary tool for converting\nback and forth between 2D and 3D coordinates:\n\n  - 3D geometry such as points, directions and line segments can be projected\n    _into_ a sketch plane, which effectively projects the geometry _onto_ the\n    sketch plane and then expresses the projected geometry _in_ 2D coordinates.\n  - 2D geometry can be place _onto_ a sketch plane to result in 3D geometry. For\n    example, a 2D point placed onto a sketch plane will result in a 3D point\n    _on_ that sketch plane that has the given 2D coordinate _in_ the sketch\n    plane.\n\nThis allows you to create algorithms that project from 3D into 2D, perform some\ncalculations in 2D, then convert the result back to 3D.\n\nMany 3D data types have `projectInto` functions that return the corresponding 2D\ndata type, and `on` functions for converting back to 3D. For example,\n[`Triangle3d.projectInto`](OpenSolid-Triangle3d#projectInto) returns a\n`Triangle2d` and [`Triangle3d.on`](OpenSolid-Triangle3d#on) returns a\n`Triangle3d`. These pairs of functions are almost, but not quite, inverses of\neach other:\n\n    triangle2d\n        |> Triangle3d.on sketchPlane\n        |> Triangle3d.projectInto sketchPlane\n\nwill just return the original `triangle2d` value (within roundoff error), while\n\n    triangle3d\n        |> Triangle3d.projectInto sketchPlane\n        |> Triangle3d.on sketchPlane\n\nis equivalent to\n\n    triangle3d\n        |> Triangle3d.projectOnto\n            (SketchPlane3d.plane sketchPlane)\n\n@docs SketchPlane3d\n\n\n# Constants\n\nThese predefined sketch planes all have the global origin point as their origin\npoint, and use the two indicated global axes as their X and Y axes. For example,\n\n    SketchPlane3d.originPoint SketchPlane3d.yz\n    --> Point3d.origin\n\n    SketchPlane3d.xDirection SketchPlane3d.yz\n    --> Direction3d.y\n\n    SketchPlane3d.yDirection SketchPlane3d.yz\n    --> Direction3d.z\n\n@docs xy, yx, yz, zy, zx, xz\n\n\n# Constructors\n\nSketch planes can also be constructed from `Frame3d` values using\n`Frame3d.xySketchPlane` etc.\n\n@docs with, on, throughPoints, fromPlane, unsafe\n\n\n# Properties\n\n@docs originPoint, xDirection, yDirection, normalDirection, xAxis, yAxis, normalAxis, plane\n\n\n# Transformations\n\n@docs flipX, flipY, moveTo, rotateAround, rotateAroundOwn, translateBy, translateAlongOwn, mirrorAcross\n\n\n# Coordinate conversions\n\n@docs relativeTo, placeIn\n\n",

This module contains a variety of\nvector-related functionality, such as\n\n  - Adding or subtracting vectors\n  - Finding the lengths of vectors\n  - Rotating vectors\n  - Converting vectors between different coordinate systems\n\nNote that unlike in many other geometry packages where vectors are used as a\ngeneral-purpose data type, OpenSolid has separate data types for vectors,\ndirections and points.
