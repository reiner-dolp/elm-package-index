[{"name":"History","comment":" This library gives you a way to manage a series of values where you are only interested in one\nvalue at a time and are interested in potentially revisiting previous values.\n\nThe provided data structure is referred to here as a \"History\", although it is more often referred to as\na [\"Zip List\"][2]. This is meant to provide you with a better idea of what you can effectively use this\nlibrary for. Namely, you can use this data structure to power any feature that fits the pattern of\n\"undo\" and \"redo\".\n\nFor more insights on why you might want to use this data structure, I highly reccomend watching [this talk][1]\n\nIf you are here looking for a way to manage the actual history of a web browser, you should instead\nbe looking at the [elm/Browser][3] package.\n\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcgmSRJHu_8\n[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipper_(data_structure)\n[3]: https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/browser/latest/Browser-Navigation#pushUrl\n\n\n# The Data Structure\n\n@docs History\n\n\n# Create\n\n@docs new, fromList\n\n\n# Maneuvering\n\n@docs forward, back, current, to\n\n\n# Transform\n\n@docs map\n\n","unions":[{"name":"History","comment":" A \"History\" of values.\n","args":["a"],"cases":[]}],"aliases":[],"values":[{"name":"back","comment":" Moves backward in the history.
