Imagine modeling a conversation as a tree structure, where a set of sibling nodes answer a question represented in the common parent. Would you allow two nodes representing the answer 'no'? By having access to the context when defining how nodes should look, you can render these error messages flexibly to the user.\n\nThe best part: at no point will you have to think about traversing a recursive tree structure.
