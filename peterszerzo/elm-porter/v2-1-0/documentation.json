For most use-cases, using Porter itself should be sufficient. If, however, you have a tangible issue with expressing chaining and transformations with your port messages, read along :).\n\nThe setup is exactly the same as when using Porter normally. Just use the `request` and `send` commands that this module provides instead to create requests with specialized return types.\n\nMapping over responses and chaining requests is supported.\n\n\n# Send Messages\n\n@docs Request\n@docs request, send\n@docs fromSimple\n\n\n# Chain Requests\n\n@docs andThen, andThenResult, map, map2, map3\n\n",
