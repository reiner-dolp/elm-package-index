A single function `solutionGenerator` is exposed which will\nproduce a generator that can be used to evolve a \"good enough\" solution.\n\nNote - This generator has a recursive structure and will block the thread until `isDoneEvolving` returns\n`True`.\n\nAlternatively, if you don't want to block the thread you can use `executeInitialStep` and `executeStep` and control when the next iteration of the algorithm executes.\n\nSee the `examples` directory for an example of each.\n\n@docs IntermediateValue, Method, Options, dnaFromValue, executeInitialStep, executeStep, numGenerationsFromValue, solutionGenerator\n\n",
