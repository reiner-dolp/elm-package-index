It cannot give you `Europe/Stockholm`, `Asia/Tokyo`, or any other\nnormal time zone from the [full list][tz] due to limitations in JavaScript.\nFor example, if you run `here` in New York City, the resulting `Zone` will\nnever be `America/New_York`. Instead you get `Etc/GMT-5` or `Etc/GMT-4`\ndepending on Daylight Saving Time. So even though browsers must have internal\naccess to `America/New_York` to figure out that offset, there is no public API\nto get the full information. This means the `Zone` you get from this function\nwill act weird if (1) an application stays open across a Daylight Saving Time\nboundary or (2) you try to use it on historical data.\n\n**Future Note:** We can improve `here` when there is good browser support for\nJavaScript functions that (1) expose the IANA time zone database and (2) let\nyou ask the time zone of the computer. The committee that reviews additions to\nJavaScript is called TC39, and I encourage you to push for these capabilities!

It is helpful\nto see its definition:\n\n    andThen : Result e a -> (a -> Result e b) -> Result e b\n    andThen result callback =\n        case result of\n          Ok value -> callback value\n          Err msg -> Err msg\n\nThis means we only continue with the callback if things are going well. For\nexample, say you need to use (`toInt : String -> Result String Int`) to parse\na month and make sure it is between 1 and 12:\n\n    toValidMonth : Int -> Result String Int\n    toValidMonth month =\n        if month >= 1 && month <= 12\n            then Ok month\n            else Err \"months must be between 1 and 12\"\n\n    toMonth : String -> Result String Int\n    toMonth rawString =\n        toInt rawString `andThen` toValidMonth\n\n    -- toMonth \"4\" == Ok 4\n    -- toMonth \"9\" == Ok 9\n    -- toMonth \"a\" == Err \"cannot parse to an Int\"\n    -- toMonth \"0\" == Err \"months must be between 1 and 12\"\n\nThis allows us to come out of a chain of operations with quite a specific error\nmessage. It is often best to create a custom type that explicitly represents\nthe exact ways your computation may fail. This way it is easy to handle in your\ncode.\n",
